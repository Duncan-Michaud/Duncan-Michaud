Hello, 

My name is Duncan Michaud. I am an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering at Northeastern University. 
I worked at Kostas Research Insitute as an additive manufacturing engineer from January through August of 2024 as my first Northeastern Co-Op. 
Career-wise, I am interested in the field of additive manufacturing, but am looking to possibly diversify my interests and apply what I have learned 
with my time at KRI with my second Co-Op.
